There was once a thirsty crow that sat by a long pitcher that had very little water. He was so thirsty that he put his beak into the pitcher and got it stuck in there.
Somehow the crow got his beak out of the pitcher and crow tried to push the pitcher down to let the water out but the pitcher was too heavy.
