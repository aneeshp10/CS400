I'm a junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. Hailing from India, I am really grateful to be at 
Madison where I get an opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds and cultures. I value diversity and inclusivity, and UW's core values align perfectly with mine.
